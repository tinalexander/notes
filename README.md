Notes taken by [Alexander Tin](https://github.com/tinalexander) while covering federal responses to COVID-19 and other public health issues for CBS News.

Before December 2022, many of my notes were previously written in [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alexander_tin), shared as screenshots to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexander_tin) account, and manually imported into this repository. You can also see an archived copy [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20221213153005/https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alexander_tin).

While I try my best to be accurate here, there are probably plenty of typos, misheard quotes, and other errors that I haven't noticed. Any time codes correspond to my internal tracking and don't always align to the media I've linked to.
