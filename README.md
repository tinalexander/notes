This repository contains notes taken by [Alexander Tin](https://github.com/tinalexander) while covering federal responses to COVID-19 and other public health issues for CBS News.

Before December 2022, many of my notes were previously written in [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alexander_tin) before being shared on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexander_tin). My plan is to copy those manually into here. They're also on the Internet Archive [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20221213153005/https://www.getrevue.co/profile/alexander_tin).

While I try my best to be accurate, there are typos, misheard quotes, and other errors that I haven't noticed. Time codes won't always align to the media I've linked to.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or concerns! The best way to get in touch is by email: [TinA@CBSNews.com](mailto:TinA@CBSNews.com)
