### From a WHO webinar

[27;23] JOHN BEIGEL, NIH: Yeah, we’ve had some preliminary discussions with the FDA. We anticipate to get it started within the next four weeks, ideally, sooner, but we’ll see.

...

[25;13] JOHN BEIGEL, NIH: So the way we’re thinking of a dose sparing study, and the caveat is that this is still in development, is to do a first do an immunogenicity study. It’s a healthy volunteer, that includes risk groups, but not limited to risk groups, three arms, the intradermal, again the one fifth dose, the one dose, arm two is the one dose, and arm three is a comparator, which is the two doses.
That, the analysis would be to compare the titers of intradermal sub-q to both in terms of immunogenicity and in terms of adverse events so you can really understand the trade off.
I mean, there is going to be a trade off of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and trying to understand if that’s an acceptable trade off. And then compare that to the standard dose and to say, are we actually within range of the standard dose? Are we in range to what you would expect for ACAM 2000?

...

[1;05;18] ELISSA MEITES, CDC: The CDC has already initialized several studies to answer key unknowns related to monkeypox, including seroprevalence studies, clinical studies, and laboratory studies. One example is an ongoing technical assistance that is a collaboration between CDC and the D.C. Department of Health, which will include collection of data to be used for early VE evaluation.

...

[1;06;40] ELISSA MEITES, CDC: Additional opportunities to assess monkeypox VE are being actively explored. Opportunities may exist to leverage existing CDC surveillance platforms that are already well established in STD clinics or LGBTQ plus health clinics, meaning lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities. And these are already engaged in gay bisexual and other men who have sex with men and transgender people to provide data and specimens for research and surveillance on sexually transmitted infections. So some examples listed here include existing HIV, STD, gonorrhea, syphilis, and human papillomavirus surveillance platforms.

### From an HHS spokesperson

The referenced vaccine doses were delivered to the SNS for potential use for a smallpox response and would only be able to be used under a potential Emergency Use Authorization. The last doses of Imvamune (name of product before FDA licensure) arrived at the SNS in 2015 and the last doses expired in 2017. The vaccine was not approved for smallpox and monkeypox until 2019. The SNS continues to store the expired doses in quarantine. While it is highly unlikely that these doses remain viable, we sent sample vials to Bavarian Nordic for stability testing. If testing confirms retained potency, which we believe is unlikely based on experience with similar vaccines, we will work with FDA to see if these doses can be made available for the response; however, HHS’ current response does not rely upon these doses.

### From an Alliance for Health Policy video

[YouTube 19;06] ROBERT CALIFF, FDA: I’m going to assume that everyone on this call knows that, if the user fees are not enacted, the greatest suffering with be from the American people because our public health mission will be injured if we don’t have the money to pay employees. And I think we’ve been through this sort of situation before.
Now, I do want to say that we’ve been, and you’ve heard the public statements from all of the elements of the Congress, that there is an intention to pass legislation that will fund the FDA before the money runs out.
But it’s also the case that, by about the first week in September, unless we have great assurance that it’s either passed or it’s about to be passed, we’ll have to start notifying employees who are paid by user fees of impending personnel action because we’re really required to. And it’s— I’ve worked in all the industries, and you owe it to someone to give them due notice of problems are going to occur.

...

[YouTube 39;26] ROBERT CALIFF, FDA: With regard to infant formula, we’re already inspecting foreign plants.
It does turn out, if you look at the enforcement discretion decisions that we’ve made, there’s still a limited number of manufacturers, including the foreign ones.
Some of the incumbent manufacturers in the U.S. had foreign plants that have gotten enforcement discretion.
And so we fully intend to inspect those plants just as frequently as the U.S. plants, because this is— if there’s one thing we’ve all learned from this, it’s infant formula is a critical medicine basically. It’s a sole source of nutrition for a lot of infants.
We can’t have a system which is so dependent on just a few plants making most of the formula. We have to have a resilient system and they have to be very high quality.
You know that there’s funding at stake right now in some of the legislation. We do need more people.
But we’re just going to beg, steal, and borrow from parts of the FDA until we get this one right, including the foreign plants, so there are inspections going on right now in some of those plants.

### From a statement from Walgreens

... we began pharmacist assessment/prescribing in a limited number of stores this week.
Beginning this week, a small number of stores in Florida and Kentucky will have trained, state-licensed pharmacists on site available to perform a clinical screening and assessment, prescribe and dispense Paxlovid to eligible patients who have a tested positive for COVID-19. We have prioritized access to patients living in socially vulnerable and medically underserved communities and will continue to do so as we expand the service.
